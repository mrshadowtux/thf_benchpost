# thf_benchpost
This scripts automatically parse Geekbench accounts for results and outputs them in BBcode syntax for forum posting. Please make sure that both scripts are located in the same directory and that curl is installed.

## Creting a post for a single Geekbench URL:
./benchpost_gen.sh forum_username result_url

## Looping through all results of a Geekbench Account:
./benchpost_run.sh forum_username geekbenchacc_url

## What's missing:
Sorting of the results would be a nice thing
